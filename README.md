# NIM-Game
We want to build the nim game in C program The game goes like this: Choose the size of the three stacks. Now each player in turn can choose to download a few matches from only one of the packs (including the entire download) Please note: only download, do not add and leave in the same situation. (The software must verify this) The loser is the one who is left unable to take matches. The program opens by asking the question: please enter 3 numbers The user enters the numbers at the beginning of the game 3 21 7  And then the output is: packet sizes are 3 7 21 And the game started. If the computer starts the output is: I turned 21 to 4 packet sizes are now: 3 7 4 Your Turn please state how much to take?  Now the input user queue will look like this: 4 to 1  And then drag the computer answer: I turned 7 to 2 packet sizes are now 1 3 2  Your Turn please state how much to take?  And here's a possible response:  3 to 0  Computer Response: I turned 2 to 1 packet sizes are now: 0 1 1 Your Turn please state how much to take?  User: 1 to 0 packet sizes are now: 0 0 1 Computer Response:  I turned 1 to 0 Game Over - You Lost !!  General instructions:  • Meaningful names should be given to variables • Proper indentations (TAB) must be followed. • Make sure "magic numbers" is set to #define • Divide the code into .c and .h files • Make sure the code is compiled and then debug by positive and negative run
